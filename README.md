# Profiles REST API

## Synopsis

REST API providing basic functionality for managing user profiles. This is currently a work in progress. Once the project is finished, I'll be fleshing out this README into something worth while!

## Motivation

This is a project I have used to learn about Django Rest APIs. It is inspired by a project by Mark Winterbottom, from his class on Udemy called, "Build a Backend Rest API with Python & Django," and follows his tutorials on how to do just that - build a backend REST API.
